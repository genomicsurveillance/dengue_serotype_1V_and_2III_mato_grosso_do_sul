# Dengue Fever Surveillance in Mato Grosso do Sul: insights from genomic analysis and implications for Public Health Strategies
# Abstract: 
Dengue fever, a prevalent vector-borne disease in Brazil, has caused widespread urban outbreaks and poses a significant public health risk since its emergence in the early 1916. Understanding the dynamics of Dengue Virus (DENV) serotypes circulating in different regions of Brazil is essential for implementing effective disease control and prevention measures. In response to this urgent need, we conducted an on-site training program in genomic surveillance in collaboration with the Central Laboratory of Health and the Secretary of Health of the Mato Grosso do Sul state. This initiative resulted in the generation of 177 DENV genome sequences collected between May 2021 and May 2022, a period during which over 11,391 dengue fever cases were reported in the state. Through this approach, we identified the co-circulation of two different dengue serotypes (DENV-1 and DENV-2) and observed the presence of distinct viral lineages within each genotype, suggesting that multiple introduction events of different viral strains occurred in the region. By integrating epidemiological data, our findings unveiled temporal fluctuations in the relative abundance of different serotypes throughout various epidemic seasons, underscoring the intricate and evolving dynamics of DENV transmission over time. These results highlight the significance of continuous surveillance efforts in monitoring viral evolution, tracking transmission patterns, and guiding public health interventions.
